OAuth2 CKAN extension   
=====================

The OAuth2 extension allows site visitors to login through an OAuth2 server. It's been modified to works with standard ckan login and also with one of the Oauth2 servers.

**Note**: This extension has been tested in CKAN 2.2 and 2.3. It may not work in other versions.

**Note**: If you want to use the FIWARE IdM, use the code on `fiware-migration` branch.
